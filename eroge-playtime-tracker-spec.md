# Eroge Playtime Tracker — Technical Specification

> Working title: `ErogePlaytimeTracker`  
> Target: Windows 10 / 11 x64  
> Status: Initial implementation specification  
> Primary use case: Record play time for visual novels / eroge per title, with ErogameScape metadata.

## 1. Goal

Create a Windows desktop application that:

- Tracks play sessions for registered games.
- Counts play time as **session running time minus background time**.
- Records one logical `PlaySession` per game launch.
- Preserves the excluded background periods inside that launch as `BackgroundInterval` records.
- Lets the user review and edit recorded sessions later.
- Retrieves game metadata such as title, brand, release date, and thumbnail from ErogameScape (批評空間).
- Lets the user filter games by brand and sort by values such as total play time and last played time.
- Runs as a normal Windows application and can stay resident in the system tray.
- Does not require the user to manually install .NET or another application runtime.

This is a **local-first desktop application**. A server/backend service is not required.

---

## 2. Chosen technology stack

### Desktop framework

- **Tauri 2**

### Backend / native logic

- **Rust**
- Windows API access via the `windows` crate.
- HTTP client: `reqwest`.
- HTML parsing: choose a maintained Rust HTML parser such as `scraper`.
- SQLite access: **`rusqlite`**.
- Serialization: `serde` / `serde_json`.

### Frontend

- **Svelte**
- **TypeScript**
- Vite-based Tauri frontend.

The frontend is responsible for presentation and user interaction only.  
Tracking, database access, metadata retrieval, and Windows integration belong in Rust.

### Database

- **SQLite**
- One local database file.
- Use migrations from the beginning.

---

## 3. High-level architecture

```text
Svelte / TypeScript UI
        |
        | Tauri commands / events
        v
Rust application layer
├── tracking
│   ├── process detection
│   ├── foreground-window detection
│   └── session state machine
├── database
│   ├── migrations
│   └── repositories
├── metadata
│   └── ErogameScape provider
├── thumbnails
└── settings
        |
        v
SQLite + local thumbnail cache
```

The tracking code should not depend directly on Svelte or UI state.  
Keep the core tracking logic independently testable.

Suggested Rust layout:

```text

├── main.rs
├── commands/
│   ├── games.rs
│   ├── sessions.rs
│   └── settings.rs
├── database/

```

Exact module names may change if there is a clear architectural reason.

## 4. Core domain model

### 4.1 Game

Represents one visual novel / eroge.

Suggested fields:

```text
Game
- id
- erogamescape_id       nullable
- title
- brand_id              nullable
- release_date          nullable
- thumbnail_path        nullable
- source_url            nullable
- created_at
- updated_at
```

### 4.2 Brand

```text
Brand
- id
- erogamescape_id       nullable
- name
```

### 4.3 GameExecutable

A game may have multiple executables.

```text
GameExecutable
- id
- game_id
- path
- file_name
- created_at
```

Important:

- Do **not** assume Game : Executable is 1:1.
- Launcher / engine / secondary executable configurations must be possible.
- Executable matching should prefer normalized full paths when available.

Example:

```text
Game
└── Executables
    ├── launcher.exe
    └── game.exe
```

### 4.4 PlaySession

One logical record per game launch.

```text
PlaySession
- id
- game_id
- launched_at
- exited_at             nullable while running
- created_at
- updated_at
```

`launched_at` and `exited_at` represent how long the game process/session existed.

Do not store total play duration as the source of truth if it can be calculated.

### 4.5 BackgroundInterval

Represents a period during a `PlaySession` in which the running game was not the foreground game.

```text
BackgroundInterval
- id
- play_session_id
- started_at
- ended_at              nullable while active
- created_at
- updated_at
```

The play time of a session is:

```text
(PlaySession.exited_at - PlaySession.launched_at)
- SUM(BackgroundInterval.ended_at - BackgroundInterval.started_at)
```

The total play time of a game is the sum across all of its sessions.

This model intentionally preserves both:

- total process/session time;
- excluded background time;
- derived play time.

Example:

```text
Game launched:       20:00
Foreground:          20:00 - 20:30
Browser foreground:  20:30 - 20:40
Foreground:          20:40 - 21:20
Discord foreground:  21:20 - 21:30
Foreground:          21:30 - 22:00
Game exited:         22:00

Session duration:    2h 00m
Background time:     0h 20m
Playtime:            1h 40m
```

---

## 5. Tracking behavior

### 5.1 Primary rule

The preferred play-time definition is:

> Start with the time for which the game session existed, then exclude periods in which the game was in the background.

A game can remain running in the background, but that period is recorded as excluded time.

### 5.2 Foreground-window detection

Use Windows APIs through the Rust `windows` crate.

Primary APIs / concepts:

- `SetWinEventHook`
- `EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND`
- `GetForegroundWindow`
- `GetWindowThreadProcessId`

Expected flow:

```text
Foreground window changed
        |
        v
Get owning PID
        |
        v
Resolve executable
        |
        v
Match executable against registered GameExecutable rows
        |
        +--> registered game -> end its BackgroundInterval
        |
        +--> anything else   -> begin BackgroundInterval for running games
```

### 5.3 Event-driven + reconciliation

Use foreground-change events as the normal mechanism.

Also implement a low-frequency reconciliation check using `GetForegroundWindow()` so the tracker can recover if an event is missed.

A reasonable initial reconciliation interval is approximately **2–5 seconds**.  
Keep the value configurable internally.

Do not use high-frequency polling when it is unnecessary.

### 5.4 Process / launch tracking

The application must know when a registered game starts and exits so that one `PlaySession` corresponds to one launch.

Implementation may use Windows process APIs, event subscriptions, or a conservative polling mechanism, but should satisfy these behaviors:

1. Registered game starts.
2. Create one `PlaySession` with `launched_at`.
3. Foreground transitions create/end `BackgroundInterval` records.
4. Registered game exits.
5. End any open `BackgroundInterval`.
6. Set `PlaySession.exited_at`.

Monitor associated process handles for exit and trigger reconciliation immediately when a PID exits. The periodic reconciliation remains as a fallback. When a game owns multiple associated processes, an individual PID exit must not end the session while another associated process remains alive.

Derive tracking state from process existence, visible top-level windows owned by associated PIDs, and foreground ownership. A process with no visible game window is Starting (before the first window) or WindowTransition/ShuttingDown (after a window existed), not Background. Record Background only while a visible game window exists and none of the game's windows owns the foreground. Close a session at the last window-loss time after process exit confirms shutdown.

### 5.5 Multiple executables for one game

Multiple registered executables may map to the same game.

Avoid generating duplicate simultaneous sessions when a launcher starts the actual game executable.

For MVP, define one logical session per game when at least one registered executable belonging to that game is alive.

State should therefore be tracked by **game**, not merely by PID.

Suggested interpretation:

```text
0 matching processes alive -> game not running
1+ matching processes alive -> game running
```

Transition from 0 to 1+ starts the session.  
Transition from 1+ to 0 ends the session.

### 5.6 Multiple registered games running

The design should tolerate multiple registered games running at the same time.

- Each running game may have its own `PlaySession`.
- Every running game other than the foreground game accumulates a `BackgroundInterval`.
- Switching foreground directly from Game A to Game B starts A's interval and ends B's interval.

---

## 6. Editing behavior

The user must be able to inspect and edit recorded data.

### Session list

For a game, show at minimum:

- launch/start datetime;
- exit/end datetime;
- derived play time;
- excluded background time;
- process/session duration.

### Session editing

Allow editing:

- `launched_at`;
- `exited_at`.

### Background interval editing

Because background intervals are the source of truth for excluded time, provide a detailed session view that allows:

- adding a background interval;
- editing start/end of a background interval;
- deleting an incorrect background interval.

Validation:

- `ended_at >= started_at`;
- background intervals should remain inside the parent session's start/end range when the session has both bounds;
- reject or normalize overlapping background intervals inside the same session;
- changing session bounds must not silently produce invalid background intervals.

### Manual session creation

Allow a user to add a session manually.

For a simple manual entry, it is acceptable to create:

- one `PlaySession`;
- no `BackgroundInterval` (the manually entered range is all play time).

### Legacy compatibility

Keep the original `focus_intervals` table for rollback compatibility. Existing focus data is migrated by storing its complement inside each closed session as `background_intervals`. New tracking and manual edits keep `focus_intervals` updated as a compatibility mirror, while all current-version calculations use sessions minus background intervals.

---

## 7. ErogameScape / 批評空間 metadata

### Purpose

Retrieve and populate game metadata such as:

- title;
- brand;
- release date;
- thumbnail / package image when available;
- ErogameScape game ID;
- source URL.

### Provider abstraction

Do not couple the application directly to one scraper implementation.

Define a provider abstraction conceptually similar to:

```rust
trait GameMetadataProvider {
    async fn fetch_game(&self, id: /* ... */) -> Result<GameMetadata, MetadataError>;
    async fn search(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Vec<GameSearchResult>, MetadataError>;
}
```

Exact Rust async-trait mechanics may differ.

Implement:

```text
ErogameScapeProvider
```

behind this abstraction.

This is important because the HTML structure may change in the future and other providers could be added later.

### Input methods

MVP should support at least one reliable registration method:

- ErogameScape game URL; or
- ErogameScape game ID.

Title search can be implemented if reliable enough, but URL/ID registration is sufficient for the first working milestone.

### Scraping behavior

- Use `reqwest`.
- Parse HTML using a maintained parser.
- Keep CSS selectors / parsing details isolated inside the ErogameScape provider.
- Use a sensible User-Agent.
- Avoid aggressive request rates.
- Do not repeatedly fetch unchanged metadata on every application launch.

### Thumbnail behavior

Download the thumbnail once and cache it locally.

Suggested data directory:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\ErogePlaytimeTracker\
├── app.db
├── thumbnails\
└── logs\
```

Do not depend on ErogameScape being reachable merely to render the existing game library.

---

## 8. UI requirements

The UI does not need elaborate visual effects. Prefer a clean desktop-library layout.

### 8.1 Main game library

Each game entry should show at least:

- thumbnail;
- title;
- brand;
- total play time;
- last played datetime.

### 8.2 Filter

Support filtering by:

- brand.

Also provide a title/text search if inexpensive to implement.

### 8.3 Sorting

Support at least:

- title;
- brand;
- release date;
- registration date;
- total play time;
- last played datetime;
- play-session count.

Ascending/descending switching should be possible where appropriate.

### 8.4 Game detail

Show:

- thumbnail;
- title;
- brand;
- release date;
- registered executable paths;
- total play time;
- total launched/running time if useful;
- last played datetime;
- session history.

Actions:

- add/remove executable;
- edit metadata where reasonable;
- refresh ErogameScape metadata;
- add/edit/delete session records.

### 8.5 Add game

Initial flow:

1. Enter ErogameScape URL or ID.
2. Fetch metadata.
3. Show preview.
4. Register game.
5. Add one or more executable paths.

Also permit a manually-created game when metadata retrieval fails.

### 8.6 System tray

The app should support resident operation.

Tray behavior:

- opening the main window;
- showing basic tracking state;
- exiting the application cleanly.

Closing the main window may minimize/hide to tray rather than terminate the tracker.  
Make the behavior explicit in settings if needed.

### 8.7 Auto-start

Support optional launch at Windows sign-in using an appropriate Tauri 2 plugin or equivalent native implementation.

Default may be off for the first build.

---

## 9. Tauri command boundary

Do not expose raw SQL or low-level tracking internals to the frontend.

Commands should be task-oriented, for example:

```text
list_games
get_game
create_game
update_game
delete_game

add_game_executable
remove_game_executable

list_sessions
create_manual_session
update_session
delete_session

list_background_intervals
create_background_interval
update_background_interval
delete_background_interval

fetch_erogamescape_metadata
refresh_game_metadata

get_settings
update_settings
```

Tracking status changes can be pushed to the frontend using Tauri events where appropriate.

---

## 10. Database notes

Use SQLite migrations.

Recommended initial tables:

```text
brands
games
game_executables
play_sessions
background_intervals
focus_intervals            legacy compatibility mirror
settings
```

Potential indexes:

```text
game_executables(path)
play_sessions(game_id, launched_at)
background_intervals(play_session_id, started_at)
focus_intervals(play_session_id, started_at)
games(brand_id)
```

Store timestamps consistently.

Recommended choice:

- UTC in the database;
- convert to local time in the UI.

If another timestamp representation is chosen, keep it consistent throughout the application.

Foreign keys should be enabled.

Deletion behavior should be intentional, e.g. deleting a game may cascade to its executables/sessions after explicit confirmation.

---

## 11. Derived statistics

Do not duplicate statistics in the database unless profiling proves it necessary.

Derive:

### Total play time

```text
SUM(all PlaySession durations for game)
- SUM(all BackgroundInterval durations for game)
```

### Last played time

Prefer:

```text
The end of the most recent foreground portion, derived from the session end and any trailing BackgroundInterval.
```

with a reasonable fallback for an active session if needed.

### Session count

```text
COUNT(PlaySession)
```

### Total running time

```text
SUM(PlaySession.exited_at - PlaySession.launched_at)
```

---

## 12. Runtime state

The tracker should maintain an in-memory state representing:

```text
registered executable paths
running games
running process IDs per game
active foreground game
open PlaySession IDs
open BackgroundInterval IDs by session
open legacy FocusInterval ID
```

Database writes should happen at meaningful state transitions rather than on every polling tick.

Examples of write points:

- game transitions from not-running -> running;
- foreground switches to registered game;
- foreground leaves registered game;
- game transitions from running -> not-running.

---

## 13. Reliability requirements

Tracking correctness is more important than extremely small code size.

Handle gracefully:

- process disappears between enumeration and inspection;
- executable path cannot be read due to permissions;
- foreground HWND becomes invalid;
- game exits while focused;
- app exits while a session is active;
- transient database failures;
- ErogameScape unavailable or HTML parsing fails;
- thumbnail download failure.

Failures in metadata retrieval must not stop local play-time tracking.

Log useful errors locally without logging unnecessarily sensitive data.

### Crash / unclean-exit recovery

For the first implementation, at minimum detect open sessions / intervals left from a previous unclean app shutdown.

Do not silently count time from the crash until the next app start.

A conservative recovery strategy is acceptable, such as closing orphaned records at a persisted last-seen timestamp or marking them for user review.

---

## 14. Privacy and network behavior

The core tracker is local.

Network access should occur only for metadata/thumbnail retrieval or other explicitly networked features.

Do not upload play history.

Do not require an account.

---

## 15. Distribution

Target:

```text
Windows 10 / 11 x64
```

Primary deliverable:

- Windows `.exe` installer generated through Tauri.

The user should not need to manually install .NET, Node.js, Rust, or development tooling.

### WebView2

Tauri uses Microsoft WebView2 on Windows.

Packaging should ensure a normal end user does not have to manually resolve this dependency.

Preferred approach:

- use Tauri's supported Windows installer behavior for WebView2 installation/bootstrap; or
- bundle a fixed WebView2 runtime if a fully self-contained distribution is explicitly chosen later.

A literal portable one-file executable is **not a hard MVP requirement** if it would make WebView2 distribution unnecessarily complex.  
A single installer `.exe` with no manual prerequisite installation is acceptable.

---

## 16. Development principles

- Keep native Windows / process / foreground logic in Rust.
- Keep persistence behind repository/service boundaries.
- Keep ErogameScape parsing isolated behind a provider abstraction.
- Keep Svelte focused on UI.
- Prefer simple, explicit code over framework-heavy architecture.
- Avoid premature optimization.
- Write tests for tracking state transitions and time aggregation.
- Add migrations instead of mutating schema ad hoc.
- Do not store redundant duration values as authoritative state.

---

## 18. MVP acceptance criteria

The first usable release is complete when all of the following work:

1. The application runs on Windows 10/11 x64.
2. A game can be registered manually.
3. Multiple executable paths can be attached to one game.
4. Starting a registered game creates one `PlaySession`.
5. The game accumulates play time only while one of its registered executables owns the foreground window.
6. Alt-Tabbing away stops active play-time accumulation.
7. Returning to the game resumes accumulation inside the same launch session.
8. Exiting the game closes the session.
9. Session history can be viewed.
10. Session and focus-interval data can be edited.
11. Total play time is derived correctly from session time minus background time.
12. Games can be filtered by brand.
13. Games can be sorted by total play time and last played time.
14. Game metadata can be populated from ErogameScape by URL or ID.
15. Thumbnails are cached locally.
16. The app can remain resident in the system tray.
17. Metadata/network failure does not break play-time tracking.
18. End users do not need to manually install .NET, Rust, Node.js, or development tools.

---

## 19. Explicit non-goals for the initial version

Unless necessary for the architecture, do not prioritize:

- cloud synchronization;
- user accounts;
- mobile support;
- macOS/Linux support;
- social features;
- achievements;
- automatic game discovery across the whole disk;
- Steam integration;
- complex analytics dashboards;
- plugin systems;
- multiple metadata providers beyond the abstraction needed to support them later.

---

## 20. Important design decisions to preserve

These decisions are intentional and should not be casually changed during implementation:

1. **Rust + Tauri 2 + Svelte + TypeScript** is the selected stack.
2. **SQLite + rusqlite** is the selected local persistence approach.
3. Foreground time is the primary play-time metric.
4. A launch is represented by `PlaySession`.
5. Background periods inside a launch are represented by `BackgroundInterval`.
6. A game can have multiple registered executables.
7. Session state is tracked per game, not per PID.
8. Durations are derived from timestamps rather than treated as independent authoritative values.
9. ErogameScape integration is isolated behind a provider abstraction.
10. Local tracking must continue to work when ErogameScape/network access fails.
11. A Windows installer `.exe` with automatic dependency handling is acceptable for MVP.
